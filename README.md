# RTCTunnel

RTCTunnel builds network tunnels over WebRTC.

_WARNING: this is a proof of concept and should not be used in production. Things like disconnects and invalid data are not handled gracefully and will result in the program crashing._

An overview of the application and how and why it was built is available here: http://www.doxsey.net/blog/rtctunnel--building-a-webrtc-proxy-with-go.
